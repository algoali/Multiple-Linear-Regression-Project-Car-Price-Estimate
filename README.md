# Multiple Linear Regression Project (Car-Price-Estimate)

In the 1980s, a car manufacturer from the Far East wanted to enter the American market.

They contract with a consultancy firm to find out which factors are important on car prices.

What they want to learn:

* Which variable(s) are important in determining the prices of cars?
* To what extent do these variables affect car prices?

In line with these requests, the consultancy firm collected data on various brands and models.

Our task is to prepare and present a model that shows the variables and to what extent the price changes.
